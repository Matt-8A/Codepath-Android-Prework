## Notes

One big challenge when building the app was having to set up the emulator, having an AMD CPU has caused 
one issue in which I needed to download the Android Emulator Hypervisor Driver and toggle SVM on in the BIOS.
At then end once I rebooted my pc with all required settings the emulator was up and running.
